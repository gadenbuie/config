The purpose of the `config` package is to respond to environment variables that could be set to different values on different machines. Specifically, config reacts to the value of `R_CONFIG_ACTIVE`, and this allows you to set configurations for different machines, e.g. in dev or production.

If you deploy your code to a Posit Connect instance, then you can use the fact that Connect sets the value of `R_CONFIG_ACTIVE` to `rsconnect`.

This means you can create a configuration file using the value `rsconnect`, for example:

``` yaml
default:
  trials: 5
  dataset: "data-sampled.csv"
  
rsconnect:
  trials: 30
  dataset: "data.csv"
```

Note: this value can be configured by your system administrator, so check your own system configuration!  See <https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/appendix/configuration/#R.ConfigActive> for detail.
